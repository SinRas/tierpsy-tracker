# Installation Instructions


## 1. Installing with Docker

You can now download and use Tierpsy Tracker as a Docker image.

If you are not familiar with Docker, this is as if you were given a brand new
computer with Tierpsy Tracker pre-installed.
After the installation, you will only have to click on a Desktop icon to run
Tierpsy Tracker.

This is the preferred installation method if you just want to install and use
Tierpsy Tracker, especially if you are a Windows user.

See [install Tierpsy Tracker with Docker](INSTALLATION_DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions.


## 2. Installing from source

If you are interested in having access to Tierpsy Tracker's source code,
want to always have the most up-to-date version,
or if you plan to contribute to Tierpsy Tracker's development, then you should
[install Tierpsy Tracker from source](INSTALLATION_SOURCE.md).


## 3. Installing from conda [deprecated]

You can [install a legacy version of Tierpsy Tracker using the package manager conda](INSTALLATION_CONDA.md), although we do not recommend this as an installation route.



# Tests
After installing you can run the testing scripts using the command `tierpsy_tests` in the terminal/Anaconda prompt/Docker container. Type `tierpsy_tests -h` for help. Although the script supports running multiple tests consecutively, I would recommend to run one test at the time since there is not currently a way to summarise the results of several tests.
